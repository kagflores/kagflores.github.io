When I was little, I watched *Jurassic Park* and I was done. I was in love. Not with the crazy dinosaur chases or the whole people getting eaten part but rather with that one scene where the crew is out in Montana uncovering dinosaur bones. I was going to be a paelontologist. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school when it was time to choose a college and a course of study. Well that was easy. Pick the schools that have the best geology program with professors who are paleontologists. This criteria led me to Southern Methodist University where I had tremendous exposure to geology, palentology, and I was even able to get my hands wet with several field exercises. I loved it. When graduation rolled around, I applied for and was accepted to the "Master's Fellowship Program" at a National Laboratory in my hometown. It was a great gig: they paid for my master's degree, gave me a stipend while in the program, and then I worked for them for at least 1.5 years to "pay it all off". The catch? I had to study something the Labs was focused on. Apparently the growth and development of sauropods does not factor heavily into national security concerns. 

With encouragement from family, friends, professors, and my future employers, I entered into the program and selected the University of Michigan for my Master's degree. Why UM? Well, it is a top rated geology program, of course, but also, the school has a notoriously great paleontology program with many paleontologists on staff. I was going to study geology while getting as much exposure to paleontology as possible.

When my Master's degree was complete, I dutifully travelled back to my hometown and fulfilled my committment to MFP but then something happened. I stuck around. I still loved paleontology but started to see some of the issues and struggles with the filed while I was at Michigan and I really enjoyed my geology-focused work. So, I continued on with the company for several more years.

This is where things get crazy. One night when having drinks with friends, I reconnected with a friend I made in ninth grade! We were close all through high school and even went to our first school dance together but never dated. We stayed connected through undergrad but had lost touch in grad school. But, here he was, back home in law school. I'll fast forward again through the sappy stuff but our high school friendship *finally* became a romantic one and we married in 2014. Oh, did I forget to mention that he was in the process of becoming an officer in the United States Marine Corps?

A few weeks after we married, I left my job, we packed our house, and we drove across the country. He was at a school so I was taking a break from work until we settled at our first duty station where I would jump right back into geology. Well, the Marine Corps had other ideas and sent us to Okinawa, Japan. That sounds darker than it should be. We really wanted to go to Okinawa. The travel opportunities, the cultural experience, and the "island life" were all calling to us. I just didn't realize how difficult it would be to find a fulfilling position in geosciences in our island paradise. During our time in Oki, I have served in many leadership positions and I am grateful for all that I have learned, accomplished, and given back to my community. I was lucky to meet up with a group of coders, Japanese and American, here on island who helped peak my interest in code development and different languages. I fell in love again, this time with coding. We'll be moving again when the Marine Corps tells us to and I am ready to jump back into the job market. This time, as a developer.
