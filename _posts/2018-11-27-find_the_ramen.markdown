I had such a blast with this project. For the most part. There were certainly some challenges and some, "I'm never going to get there moments" but overall, it felt great to build my own program from the ground up and dictate exactly how it would run and interface with the user. 

But first, why ramen? Our family recently returned to the US after living almost 3 years in Okinawa, Japan. It was an incredible experience that allowed us to travel to incredible places, and, of course, eat all the things. We fell in love with Ramen in Okinawa and in mainland Japan. Every prefecture has their own take on the delicious dish and we enjoyed every variety. After returning to the US, my husband and I took two different approaches. He found the first ramen place he could and tested it to compare with our still fresh taste bud memories of the "real" stuff. Me, I've avoided it like the plague nervous that it won't hold a candle to what we experienced in Japan and I would become endlessly disappointed. Here we are, 4 months after our return and I still haven't had ramen. It's time.

After my initial project meeting, I learned that the website I intended to use was not going to work out. So, after my rocky start, I was able to pick a new site and get rolling. I am so grateful for the coaching I received that saved me a lot of heartache from the outset fo the project! In its final form, my ramen CLI uses the Eater - San Diego website which lists the top 13 ramen shops in San Diego, near to where we live now. I appreciated most the descriptions where I recognized familiar terms like shio, chashu, and even *izakaya* or informal Japanese style bar. Now, to capture all of this information and build a meaningful CLI.

Armed with knowledge from all of the projects and lessons leading up to this final project, especially the Student Scraper, I was able to get through the scraping portion of the lab fairly quickly. My biggest struggle was trying to figure out the files that we hadn't dealt with as much moving through the curriculum. Did I *need* an environment file in my bin folder? Was I supposed to build out my .gemspec file? What kind of information went in to each of these? Well, it depends. I was able to utilize previous projects, labs, and the CLI example provided to pull together these additional files that I initially considered "accessory" files but now understand to be critical. I look forward to continue learning more about these files and certainly paying more attention to them in the upcoming lessons.

For now, I'm just so excited to have my own code up and running. It works! And I built it! Wow. This whole process of learning to code has been quite a journey and I'm excited to continue moving forward. I'm also looking forward to my first bowl of ramen in the US! Which one will you try?
