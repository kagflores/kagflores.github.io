Write about something you built using Arrays. Explain the project, your solution, and what you could have done better.

The lesson on nested arrays proved to be an important turning point for me. I struggled with one project for far too long before seeking help in an "Ask me anything" class. The solution was incredibly simple and I was instantly deflated.

I had written, rewritten, tweaked, and adjusted my code for days to find that I had it right from the start aside from an ill-placed "return". After dusting off my ego, I was able to regroup and feel incredibly thankful. Thankful for the resources provided but also for all of the troubleshooting I forced myself to do. I watched YouTube videos. I read blogs. I utilized IRB to step in to every piece of the code and really understand what was happening, when it was happening, and why it was happening. The reading and the labs gave me a great foundation for what I needed to do but after stepping in to each line, I was able to gain a full understanding of the commands we were using. I now recognize that .each returns an array. Every. Time. When I need a specific value within an array, I have to set up variable that captures that array at a given index. Knowing *when* I need to call or return a variable is critical. Does the puts line need to be within the if-else statement or within the .each iterator? Can I tighten this up by using a .none? How can I tap in to one index and return the value I need?

I'm grateful I had the opportunity to get so wildly stuck that I had to dig in and really investigate how arrays work and some of the ins, outs, and tricks to working with arrays.
